    <p>Welcome to my blog! I have been working on and off setting this up for a couple of months, and now it's in a decent enough place to start writing. </p><blockquote><p> What are you going to blog about? </p></blockquote><p>I'm hoping to use this space to share my experiences and thoughts related to software development, but I may also ramble on about punk rock, tabletop rpgs, video games or whatever I feel like.</p><blockquote><p> What is this built with? </p></blockquote><p>This site uses a <a href='https://clojure.org/'>Clojure</a> based markdown-to-static-site backend that I built. The site's static assets are then hosted using <a href='https://pages.github.com/'>GitHub Pages</a>. This enables a low-friction authoring experience that allows me to change the site as I see fit.</p><p>I made the fun mistake coupling building this site + learning <a href='https://clojure.org/'>Clojure</a>, which took some time to get comfortable with as it's my first <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_&#40;programming_language&#41;'>Lisp</a>. Even though it took longer than expected to build, I don't regret it as I learned a ton about Clojure and had a blast building it.</p>
